## Building the firmware

### Prerequisites

* Python 2.7+ or Python 3.2+
* ARM GCC Embedded 4.9+

### Building

After cloning this repository, execute the following:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd firmware
make -j8
```

The build outputs will be available in the directory `build/`.

## Flashing the firmware

### Via UART

#### Connecting USB-UART adapter

FTDI cable is the recommended USB-UART adapter.
5 V and 3.3 V FTDI cables work fine, 3.3 V is recommended.
Use the following pinout when connecting:

Wire    | Signal
--------|--------
Orange  | RXD
Yellow  | TXD
Black   | GND

#### Flashing with NXP Flash Magic

Get the flashing tool from <http://www.flashmagictool.com/>.
Start the tool, then configure it as follows:

Parameter       | Value
----------------|------------------------------------
Baud rate       | 115200
Interface       | ISP
Oscilator       | 12 MHz
File            | Use the `.hex` file in the build output directory

1. Connect the USB-UART adapter.
2. Close J3 to select serial bootloader.
3. Close J4 to force the LPC to start the bootloader.
4. Power up the board.
5. Run the flashing tool.

### Via DroneCode Probe

[DroneCode Probe](https://docs.zubax.com/dronecode_probe) is a generic JTAG / SWD + UART console adapter
compatible with most ARM Cortex based designs and in particular with hardware maintained by the
[DroneCode project](http://dronecode.org).

In order to flash the board using this tool, simply connect the debugger and execute the script
`blackmagic_flash.sh`.
